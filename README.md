# AJStory
Personal Python Game Repo.

This is a personal passion project of mine that I began working on October 10th, 2023. I started this project to set motion a string of ideas circulating in my thoughts over the last year or so.
This goal of this project is to create a game to retell the stories that I created as a kid, ranging from my earliest stories 13 years old to my most recent ones that are about 6 years old.
The stories that I did write are a pretty big mess, considering I was but a young and aspiring kid full of ideas for cool comics.

The game I create here will be revamping many of these stories with a deeper sense of story and depth to it to make it not only enticing for my past child, but for my present adult too.
To begin, I will be recreating the first complete novel I wrote, centered on characters whom I had adored from an old game called Faunasphere which shut down in 2010.
It will be a 2D-style game with some 3D elements to it, just like Faunasphere, to recreate the feel. There will be other similar aspects but the game will follow the story I wrote as a kid.
There will be much more to it I add too to give the story a much richer feeling and to depict arcs I never fully explored.

Current Development Timeline
December 2022: I wrote a written summary of the very first complete comic I wrote, with an interest in expanding on it some time in the near future.
October 10th, 2022: I begin Game Development by creating this github. I chose to use Python for this game as it's a rather easy program to use.

Current Goals
- **Milestone 0**
- Finish setting up environment
- **Milestone 1**
- Create a playable character who can move with WASD controls, or with the mouse.
- Create a basic level the player can navigate
- Once the three goals above are met, continue
